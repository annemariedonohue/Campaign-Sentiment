# About
The purpose of this projet was to compare pre and post campaign sentiment. Article mentions were aggregated for raw data to use Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The graph visualizes positive and negative sentiment insights, with positive textual affiliation increasing and negative decreasing after the campaign was launched.
